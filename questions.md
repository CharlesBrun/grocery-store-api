1. **How long did you spend on the test? What would you add if you had more time?**

   I spent three days to finish; if I had more time, I could proceed with more options for promotions and database integration to handle the insertion of new items, updates, and deletions.

2. **What was the most useful feature that was added to the latest version of your chosen language? Please include a snippet of code that**
**shows how you've used it.**

   ...

3. **What did you find most difficult?**

   The promotion logic took some time to do and understand.

4. **What mechanism did you put in place to track down issues in production on this code? If you didnâ€™t put anything, write down what you**
**could do.**

   I could create input validations to catch some errors in the endpoints and prevent the application from breaking in production. 

5. **The Wiremock represents one source of information. We should be prepared to integrate with more sources. List the steps that we would**
**need to take to add more sources of items with diferent formats and promotions.**

    Implement new services or classes responsible for retrieving data from the new sources.
    Create mechanisms for validation and handling specific errors for each source of information.
    Test the integration with the new sources of information in different scenarios and conditions.(Testing Scalability - Integrate with a new source that experiences high traffic during peak hours.)
